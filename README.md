# SORTPEN

This repository hosts the implementation of solvers for sparse regression using sorted penalties.

The following penalties are currently available:

    - Slope (Sorted $\ell_1$)
    
    - Sorted $\ell_{1/2}$
    
    - Sorted MCP

    - Sorted logsum

    
The code provides proximal operator computation of the sorted penalties as well as an implementation of FISTA to perform regression.
