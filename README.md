# SORTPEN

This repository hosts the implementation of solvers for sparse regression using sorted penalties.
The following penalties are currently available:
    - Slope (Sorted $\ell_1$)
    - Sorted $\ell_{1/2}$
    - Sorted MCP
The code provides proximal operator computation of the sorted penalties as well as an implementation of FISTA to perform regression.
